Desktop application, Instant Messaging Service
We've had terrible experience with IM clients like Skype running on Linux (and maybe even on Windows) - they crash all the time for no apparent reason.
Main features:
 - Simple UI;
 - Low resource usage;
 - Contact list (isn't it obvious);
 - Desktop popup alerts for incoming messages;
 - Group discussions.

Android application (written in Java), 2-player versus game
Main features:
 - Game consists of several simple minigames;
 - Players play several random minigames against each other each match;
 - Players get points based on their performance in each minigame;
 - After a set amount of games played each match the player with the most points wins;
 - Multiplayer is local - 2 players play on the same device;
 - Features of each minigame:
 	- Each minigame must be relatively short (players don't want to play a 30-minute match);
 	- Each minigame must use a maximum of 2 fingers from each player (since many devices can track a maximum of 5 touches at any given time);
 	- Some phone features (such as motion sensor) are not very practical for such a game (we don't want the players wrestling to tilt the phone);
