1)Calendar for series

Im sick and tired of searching information when will my favourite series be 
aired. Our application will solve this problem.

The application will parse the IMDB website and use the gained information
in apropriate format for using it in a calender. The calender will have a user
panel where you can choose which series you want to get information for.
The information will be shown in a window when you move your mouse on the concrete day.
