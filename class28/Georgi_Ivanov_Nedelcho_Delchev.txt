Idea: 
The project aims to create an app for android phones which will generate
backing tracks for guitar for soloing.

Problem that the project solves:
It removes the need for the user to search the backing tracks by himself
and it provides a orginizing system that finds the tracks that fit his 
preferences of key, mode, style, speed, length, etc. providing a friendly 
interface all the time.

Features: 
1. The program will be using fully pre-recodred backing tracks found on the Internet by us. 
(Credits will be given to the original creators of the tracks!)
2. The app wi also include a player for the tracks
3. The user will be able to records his playing over the track
4. The user will aslo be able to add the tracks to a "favourites" list.
