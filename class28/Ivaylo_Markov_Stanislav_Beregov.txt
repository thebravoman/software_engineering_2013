2.5D DUNGEON CRAWLER
	Problem: Today's video games entertaintment industry is ruled by
	multi-million dollar first person shooters which offer better and better
	graphics with each new generation but never change the core gameplay.
	In the last decade or so gamers have been filling the pockets of greedy
	video game publishing companies receiving the same product in a different
	packaging. Better graphics have become the Holy Grail of gaming - who
	needs entertaining gameplay? Our goal is to provide them with a game that
	offers simplistic graphics but focuses on the gameplay experience itself,
	making it fun, providing customisation options but without demanding too
	much attention and complex strategies - another disadvantage of modern
	video games.
	
	Features:
		-map:
			The game will offer an endless procedurally generated map that will
			have three different themes /basements, a futuristic city with
			buildings, and the interior of the buildings/ that change up
			randomly.
		-RPG system:
			Each creature will have a set of basic characteristics which will
			affect their attacks and abilities. There will be four playable
			classes with unique attacks, each playing a different role in
			multiplayer, but equally capable of fighting the enemies by
			themselves in single player mode. Killing monsters will give
			experience points which will allow the characters to level up and
			upgrade their skills. The total amount of XP points will compete
			for a place in the highscore.
		-item system:
			Players will be able to buy weapons and ammo from vending machines.
			They will also be able to buy cybernetic upgrades /which enhance
			their characteristics/ from special stations.
		-enemies:
			There will be close combat enemies that will try to surround the
			player/s/, while ranged enemies attack them from a safe distance.
		-multiplayer
			Up to eight players will be able to team up in fighting the
			enemies. The average of their XP points will be considered for the
			highscore. There will also be a deathmatch mode where everyone
			plays against everyone.

			degrees. Output units can be C/F/K
