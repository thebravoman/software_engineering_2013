3
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:45,960
What is this? It's blue.

4
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:51,439
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

5
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,366
May be blue, but it's the bomb.

6
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,036
Tight, tight, tight... Yeah.

7
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:07,807
Blue, yellow, pink...

8
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:09,754
Whatever man,
just keep bringing me that.

9
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,766
You're all right. We're gonna
make a lot of money together.

10
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:25,156
Just remember
who you're working for.

11
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,707
What did you say?

12
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:33,110
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

13
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:35,821
Like they don't already know that?

14
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,658
Are you saying that they're stupid?

15
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:42,560
No, I'm just saying.

16
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,831
Oh yeah, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

17
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,584
So, I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

18
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:50,291
Is that it?

19
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,267
Is that what you're doing?

20
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:53,723
Tuco.

21
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:59,240
Why don't we all just...

22
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,096
relax?

23
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:10,189
Heisenberg says, "relax."

24
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:14,526
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

25
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,022
I'm relaxed...

26
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,430
Damn, man!
Look at that! Look!

27
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:35,825
Yeah. That's messed up.

28
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,185
Okay, Heisenberg!

29
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,628
Next week.

30
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,403
Adjusting for inflation...

31
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:39,681
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation,

32
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,888
say $45,000 a year.
Two kids, four years of college,

33
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:46,254
$360,000.

34
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,438
Remaing mortgage on the home,

35
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:51,415
107 thousand.

36
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:55,065
Home equity line, 30 thousand.
That's 137 thousand.

37
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:57,429
Cost of living,

38
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,632
food, clothing, utilities,

39
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:02,430
say two grand a month,

40
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,554
and that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

41
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:07,990
24K a year.

42
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,071
Provide for say,

43
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,560
10 years.

44
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:15,932
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 1, 3, 7...

45
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:19,245
737.

46
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,366
$737,000.
That is what I need.

47
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:28,528
That's what I need.

48
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:32,414
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week,

49
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,607
that's only 10½ more weeks.
Call it 11...

50
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:39,781
11 more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

51
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:44,832
It's do-able.
Definitely do-able.

52
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:29,221
Heisenberg!

53
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,825
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

54
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:40,383
What's the matter with you?

55
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:43,270
You can't take an ass-beating,
bitch?

56
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:46,140
Damn, Tuco...
- Shut up.

57
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,907
There's no pulse.

58
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,577
Do something.
- Do something?

59
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,121
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

60
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,829
Do something!
You're smart, right?

61
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:58,980
Do that... Do that thing!

62
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,981
No, there's... There's nothing.

63
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:08,251
Breathe into his mouth...
- No, they don't teach that anymore.

64
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:10,012
It doesn't work.
- You, come here!

65
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,109
Breathe into his mouth!

66
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:52,370
Get rid of him.

67
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:54,720
We can't do him like that, man.

68
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,475
Buzzards and rats and all that.

69
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:04,483
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

70
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:07,528
It sounds like arguing.

71
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:43,386
<i>Gonzo, hurry up!</i>

72
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:05,463
What's the big hurry?

73
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,585
I just think we're done here.

74
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,886
You're done.

75
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:54,401
Hey, I'm back here!

76
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,236
Hello?

77
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,836
Didn't you hear me?

78
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,675
Hey, yourself.

79
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,126
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

80
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:56,446
Are you okay?

81
00:11:58,677 --> 00:11:59,677
Great.

82
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,766
New hat?

83
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,121
I got some grilled chicken
at Albertson's.

84
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:16,767
You want me to heat some up for you?

85
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:40,214
Where've you been?

86
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:23,877
Do you know what,
I've got all this crap on my face.

87
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:25,846
Let me clean up first, okay?

88
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,764
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so...

89
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:36,454
Enough.

90
00:13:36,968 --> 00:13:37,968
Hold up.

91
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,401
Stop it.

92
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,319
Stop it!

93
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,623
I know you're scared,

94
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,587
and you're angry, and you're frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

95
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:42,779
But you cannot

96
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,009
take it out on me.

97
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,633
<i>Hey, I'm home!</i>

98
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:09,968
<i>We are dead.</i>

99
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:12,805
Dead, man!

100
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,793
<i>Muerto! Ormuerte!
However the hell you...</i>

101
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:18,184
This is conjecture.
- This is conjecture?

102
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,676
Yes. And conjecture isn't helping.
- My conjecture isn't helping. Fine.

103
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,208
Facts then. Fact A:

104
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,318
My phone rang, like, eight times last
night. Dead air, hang ups every time.

105
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,782
Second fact:

106
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:30,925
3 in the morning, I saw that black Caddy
of his cruising my neighborhood.

107
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,472
If he wanted to kill us,

108
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:36,436
he would've done it at the junkyard.
- What is that? Conjecture?

109
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,615
Are you basing that
on that he's got a normal,

110
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,318
healthy brain or something?

111
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:44,394
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

112
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,773
And that way... that way
he just kept staring at us,

113
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:48,923
saying,

114
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:50,946
"You're done."

115
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:52,881
"You're done"?

116
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:55,628
You wanna know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

117
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:58,350
That means exactly
how it sounds, yo!

118
00:16:58,673 --> 00:17:01,440
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

119
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:03,823
Right now, Tuco's thinking,
"Yeah, hey,

120
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:07,252
"they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

121
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:12,438
What happens when he decides no?

122
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:27,123
It's him or us! You understand?
It is him or us!

123
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,537
How would you do it?

124
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:40,790
What do you mean?
- Specifically,

125
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:43,144
how would you do it? Step by step.

126
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:46,511
All right.

127
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:48,783
Say we...

128
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:51,522
set up one last sale,
this is providing

129
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,613
he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

130
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:56,368
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always...

131
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,749
tests the product, right?
So,

132
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:01,538
as his head is down...
you know, just giving it a snort...

133
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,582
So three shots?

134
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:08,461
Three shots, or, I don't know, two.
- But is it two, or is it three?

135
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,948
Two would probably work, I guess.
- Two shots in the chest?

136
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:13,509
Or in the face?
- Come on...

137
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,261
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

138
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:22,832
All right. We'll put a pin in that.
But by now,

139
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:25,848
the big guy, Gonzo... he's probably
coming at you, right?

140
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:29,232
So you turn toward him...
How many shots for him?

141
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,753
He's a big guy, right?
How many shots does that take?

142
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,133
I don't know. Three shots.
- Okay, three shots.

143
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:38,241
Tuco and Gonzo. Two men down.
Now, is there anyone else there?

144
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:42,579
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

145
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:46,307
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

146
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:51,443
All right.

147
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:55,631
So we'll put a pin in that one, too.

148
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,993
Now, at this point,
how many shots have been fired?

149
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:02,075
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

150
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,125
How can you suggest

151
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,869
that we kill a man,
and you can't even open the gun?

152
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,415
It's not that easy, is it?

153
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:29,779
Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

154
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:51,467
Call Skyler.

155
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:02,980
<i>Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler, and Walter Junior.</i>

156
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:06,287
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.</i>

157
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:09,183
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already.

158
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,048
The big lug and I are gonna go try

159
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:13,294
that new restaurant
over by UNM tonight.

160
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,096
So let me know
if you guys wanna hang.

161
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,082
Listen to me. "Hang."

162
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:20,249
Walt Junior would be proud.

163
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:21,889
I know the lingo.

164
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,471
I'm still hip.

165
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,891
It's Chinese... the restaurant.

166
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:29,845
I don't know.
I just feel like Chinese.

167
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:32,955
Do you think that people in China

168
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,464
ever just feel like American?

169
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:37,622
You know, and they go out

170
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,405
and get little take-out boxes

171
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,661
with mashed potatoes and meat loaf,

172
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:48,122
and try and figure out
how to use the little knives and forks?

173
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,414
I wonder if that ever happens.

174
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:53,629
All right. I'll let you go.
So call me.

175
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,471
Skyler didn't pick up?

176
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:00,734
Obviously she's not home.

177
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,947
What was that about Chinese?

178
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,184
Dinner tonight.
That new place.

179
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,927
How late they serve?
- I don't know.

180
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:21,791
You got Dave at 8.

181
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,057
Not tonight.

182
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:28,870
Yeah, you do. Remember?
- No, that's Thursday.

183
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,281
I'm pretty sure that's Thursday.

184
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,286
Remember how, at the last minute,
they changed it around for you?

185
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,755
They were gonna charge us a penalty.

186
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,007
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

187
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:45,302
And I'm doing them, Hank. I said
I would do them, and I'm doing them.

188
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:48,848
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

189
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,107
Look out!

190
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,100
Sorry, Mr. Schrader!

191
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:03,423
Look, it's...
You know, it's just...

192
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:07,921
I think Dave is...

193
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,994
really helping you.

194
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:33,302
Sorry about that.

195
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:41,569
She's...

196
00:22:48,797 --> 00:22:51,063
Where's my phone call?

197
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:55,873
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest.

198
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:59,237
And then he says, "Give me a four."
- Gomez.

199
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,725
What do you got for me?

200
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,589
Come on. Chop-chop.

201
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:06,175
Good morning to you, too.

202
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:13,276
APD sent this over.
This was about eight or ten days ago.

203
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:16,285
You know Southwest Aniline, right?
- Yeah, off the 25?

204
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,939
Whole place smells like feet.
- This is them. Check this out.

205
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,149
Holy shit. What was that?
- Thermite.

206
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:26,830
So they tell me.

207
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,024
Burns about 5,000 degrees.

208
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:31,133
<i>Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.</i>

209
00:23:31,258 --> 00:23:32,258
Nice!

210
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:34,662
Guys who know their trade.

211
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:39,917
Wait. I take that back.

212
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:44,187
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

213
00:23:44,312 --> 00:23:47,759
Try rolling it, morons!
It's a barrel.

214
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:49,802
It rolls. Jesus.

215
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:54,891
So what'd they get?
- Methylamine, 30 gallons.

216
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:57,522
P2P?

217
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:01,272
They're cooking
old-school biker meth.

218
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,535
Who the hell still does that?

219
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,110
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

220
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:09,252
Pseudo's in short supply,

221
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:12,622
so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

222
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:15,058
That and the thermite...

223
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:18,059
I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

224
00:24:18,184 --> 00:24:19,792
But ranking them as burglars?

225
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,572
Shit! I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

226
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:27,006
They got book learnin'
but no street skills.

227
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,852
Maybe they're college kids...

228
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:30,957
chem students trying
to make a big score.

229
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:32,082
Maybe.

230
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:36,082
I tell you,
30 gallons of precursor...

231
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:38,976
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

232
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:41,729
Tell you what,

233
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:46,422
they better pray it's us who catches up
to them and not those boys from Juárez.

234
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,546
Your daughter wants out.

235
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:42,860
<i>Hey, there.</i>

236
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:45,096
<i>You've reached Walt, Skyler,
and Walter Junior.</i>

237
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:47,042
<i>We can't come
to the phone right now,</i>

238
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,167
<i>so please leave us a message.</i>

239
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,397
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

240
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:53,301
<i>I thought I'd try you
earlier this time,</i>

241
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:54,946
<i>before you go out and, you know,</i>

242
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:56,994
<i>face the day.</i>

243
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,908
<i>I'm realizing now</i>

244
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,743
<i>it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone,</i>

245
00:27:01,868 --> 00:27:04,281
<i>owing to the extra baby weight...</i>

246
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:08,501
Hey, sweetie.

247
00:27:14,437 --> 00:27:16,968
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

248
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:23,182
No, no.
Well, not all of it.

249
00:27:24,403 --> 00:27:26,838
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of...

250
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:28,940
My stomach, you know?

251
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,480
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't want to wake you.

252
00:28:00,904 --> 00:28:02,492
How would he know where I live?

253
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:05,470
You're sure it was Tuco?
- Who else could it be?

254
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:09,437
Did you ever tell him my name,
where I live or anything...

255
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,783
What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

256
00:28:11,908 --> 00:28:14,374
Did you tell them anything about me?
- I didn't say jack!

257
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:17,658
Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

258
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:19,631
He's got his ways and means, yo.

259
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:21,907
Sources, all right?
He's closing in.

260
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:28,710
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

261
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:31,459
Oh, God.
What happens then?

262
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:41,071
Look, it's got five bullets.

263
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:43,111
I finally figured out how to...

264
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,458
Look, I just finally...
I figured it out.

265
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:48,575
Say we get a second gun,
right, for you.

266
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,269
I mean, don't we, like,

267
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,772
double our chances?

268
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,398
I mean, mathematically.

269
00:28:56,745 --> 00:28:58,525
I've got a better idea.

270
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,688
Thank God!

271
00:29:02,245 --> 00:29:03,401
All right.

272
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,951
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

273
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:09,515
Beans.

274
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,127
Beans?

275
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,154
They're castor beans.

276
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,777
So what are we gonna do with them?

277
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,630
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk, huh?

278
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:22,176
Climb it and escape?

279
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:25,846
We are going to process them
into ricin.

280
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:28,641
Rice and beans?

281
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,072
Ricin.

282
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,411
It's an extremely effective poison.

283
00:29:34,536 --> 00:29:36,315
It's toxic in small doses.

284
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,984
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

285
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:41,299
All right.

286
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,907
So...
- Don't touch them.

287
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:49,245
Wait. Seriously,
you can get poison from beans?

288
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,074
Back in the late '70s,

289
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:53,999
ricin was used to assassinate
a Bulgarian journalist.

290
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:58,140
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella

291
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:00,529
to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

292
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:04,618
And we're talking about an amount not
much bigger than the head of a pin.

293
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,304
But it killed him?

294
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:14,424
Now we just need to figure
out a delivery device,

295
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:15,824
and then...

296
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,755
no more Tuco.

297
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:04,642
How you doing?

298
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:08,157
Is this...
This a bad time?

299
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:12,610
No, come on in.

300
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:23,922
I should've called first.
I'm sorry.

301
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,884
What can I do for you?

302
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,721
Maybe we ought...

303
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:35,768
You want to sit down first?

304
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:37,937
I don't know, Hank.

305
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,514
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

306
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,103
Did she send you?

307
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,113
Hell, no.

308
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:51,081
She's barely even talking to me.

309
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:53,186
That's why I'm here, okay?

310
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,021
Self-preservation.

311
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,342
Big time.

312
00:32:00,724 --> 00:32:01,794
Look,

313
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:04,880
I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

314
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:06,978
I get it.
- Gals...

315
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:09,037
And I need to get involved

316
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:11,762
like I need a second hole in my ass.

317
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:15,266
But if you could do me this huge favor
and just return her phone calls.

318
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:16,902
I don't...

319
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:20,229
think I'm quite ready
to do that yet.

320
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,690
You know, communication.
Communication, right?

321
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:24,556
The back, the forth.
Come on.

322
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:26,602
Sky, do this for me, please.

323
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,262
You can yell at her.

324
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:30,146
Just call her back.

325
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,330
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

326
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,625
That's right.

327
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,839
That "baby tiara"
she gave me at the shower?

328
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:48,765
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's.

329
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:52,949
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

330
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,471
And Marie won't admit it.

331
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,906
She won't apologize.

332
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,584
Yeah. If I thought you were gonna
return it, I would have never...

333
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:04,865
You know.

334
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:14,184
You knew about this?

335
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:16,670
We're working on it.

336
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,331
I mean, she's got
this therapist, Dave.

337
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:23,747
I mean, Dave is really good.
- Dave's good.

338
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:26,596
But it's an ongoing process, Sky,

339
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:29,823
and we have gotta be understanding.

340
00:33:29,948 --> 00:33:33,348
You know? I mean, we've gotta...
You know. We've gotta...

341
00:33:33,627 --> 00:33:35,638
support the shit out of her.

342
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:39,311
Do we?

343
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,354
I need support.

344
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:46,103
Me!

345
00:33:46,564 --> 00:33:48,783
The almost 40-year-old
pregnant woman,

346
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:50,611
with the surprise baby on the way.

347
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:53,359
And the husband with the lung cancer

348
00:33:53,484 --> 00:33:56,231
who disappears for hours on end,
and I don't know where he goes,

349
00:33:56,356 --> 00:33:58,734
and he barely even speaks
to me anymore.

350
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:01,649
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

351
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:03,594
And the overdrawn checking account.

352
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:07,278
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap

353
00:34:07,403 --> 00:34:10,589
and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet

354
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,549
and we can't even afford to fix it.

355
00:34:12,674 --> 00:34:15,380
But, oh, I see!

356
00:34:15,627 --> 00:34:18,180
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please.

357
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,933
"What can I possibly do
to further benefit

358
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:24,021
"my spoiled, kleptomaniac
bitch sister

359
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:27,194
"who somehow always manages
to be the center of attention!

360
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:30,284
"'Cause God knows she's the one

361
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,112
"with the really
important problems!"

362
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:51,255
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

363
00:35:23,994 --> 00:35:25,664
That's all it takes?

364
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,878
That's all it takes.

365
00:35:30,465 --> 00:35:32,304
So, now what?

366
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:36,286
Now, we arrange our next meet,

367
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:39,324
in a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

368
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,019
Business as usual.

369
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:44,272
And, uh, after we sell him
our usual four pounds,

370
00:35:44,397 --> 00:35:46,424
then we'll pull this out.

371
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:49,757
"By the way, Tuco,

372
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:52,193
"the new meth formula
we've been working on.

373
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,086
"Would you care to try it?"

374
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,861
Okay, well, what's new about it?

375
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:59,717
Just in case he asks.
What do we say?

376
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:01,840
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

377
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:04,677
It gets the user insanely high.

378
00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:07,669
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

379
00:36:07,794 --> 00:36:10,417
That degenerate snorts
anything he gets his hands on.

380
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,575
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

381
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,189
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,

382
00:36:18,806 --> 00:36:20,210
maybe 72,

383
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:22,930
it'll look like natural causes.

384
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:26,001
What, like a heart attack?

385
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:30,000
Or the flu, maybe.

386
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:33,256
His associates won't know
any differently,

387
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:35,442
and we'll be in the clear.

388
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,407
Not if Tuco kills us first.

389
00:36:57,137 --> 00:36:58,714
Just keep it down.

390
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,467
Hey, Hank. What's up?

391
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:02,594
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

392
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,557
You been home yet?

393
00:37:09,455 --> 00:37:10,479
Why?

394
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:11,979
<i>Well...</i>

395
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:15,566
'Cause I really screwed up.

396
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:18,980
<i>I apologize in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.</i>

397
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:21,206
<i>I'm just trying to get her
and Marie talking again.</i>

398
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:24,489
Big mistake.
I should have just kept out of it.

399
00:37:24,614 --> 00:37:26,230
<i>Yeah, well, okay.</i>

400
00:37:27,484 --> 00:37:29,453
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

401
00:37:29,578 --> 00:37:30,998
<i>Well, that happens.</i>

402
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,297
It's no problem.
No worries.

403
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:35,627
<i>Well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.</i>

404
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:39,024
Jesus, the wives, huh?

405
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:40,941
<i>Hank, unfortunately,</i>

406
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,607
<i>I really...
- Oh, yeah, man, don't let me keep you.</i>

407
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,739
Actually, I'm at work, so...

408
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,019
You wanna see
something really freaky?

409
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:55,522
<i>Well, I would, but...
- Seriously, Walt, this is...</i>

410
00:37:56,922 --> 00:38:00,915
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

411
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:10,003
Hang on, hang on.
It should be coming through right now.

412
00:38:11,337 --> 00:38:13,516
Guess it could be worse, huh?

413
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:16,543
We could be having a day
like these two.

414
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,755
<i>A couple of local bulletheads.</i>

415
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:22,883
Guess they pissed off the wrong guy.

416
00:38:25,665 --> 00:38:27,122
<i>Walt, you there?</i>

417
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:37,692
I'm taking this.
- No! It's my gun! I need it!

418
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,566
No, you don't!
Not if you leave town.

419
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:43,659
Get out of here. Tuco killing Gonzo
means he's coming after us next.

420
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,430
I've gotta get home. My family.

421
00:40:35,221 --> 00:40:36,808
Where's Walter Junior?

422
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:40,687
Having dinner at Louis's house.
Supposedly.

423
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:47,319
All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

424
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:53,292
So where have you been this time?

425
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:37,819
<i>Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?</i>

426
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,013
I'll be right there.

427
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:04,771
I recognize these two knobjobs.

428
00:42:05,294 --> 00:42:08,817
Known associates of a psychotic piece
of shit named Tuco Salamanca.

429
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,944
Guess he got tired of associating.

430
00:42:12,015 --> 00:42:15,294
Do you mind if I get in there?
- No, go ahead.

431
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:23,731
The big one smells fresher.

432
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:27,005
You guys find a death wound?

433
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:33,633
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

434
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,299
You done taking pictures?

435
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,386
All right.
Let's lay 'em out flat.

436
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:43,768
Let me get out
of your way here, man.

437
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,443
Oh, snap!

438
00:42:57,745 --> 00:43:00,535
Damn, Ricky. Leave something
for the coroner.

439
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,362
Oh, this is beautiful.

440
00:43:14,153 --> 00:43:17,798
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.
We've got the world's dumbest criminal.

441
00:43:17,923 --> 00:43:20,180
This guy wasn't murdered.
Look.

442
00:43:20,675 --> 00:43:24,351
Big Stuff, here,
was moving this guy's body,

443
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:27,928
when the stack must have shifted.

444
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:30,789
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,

445
00:43:31,038 --> 00:43:32,781
and he bled out!

446
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:35,519
Poetic justice.
Oh, I love it.

447
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:36,863
Don't you just?

448
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,982
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

449
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:43,078
Old Stumpy, here. Make sure
you get the stump in there.

450
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,129
Would you talk to me, please?

451
00:44:01,103 --> 00:44:03,217
I don't know where to begin.

452
00:44:58,344 --> 00:45:00,717
What the hell are you doing here?

453
00:45:07,386 --> 00:45:08,502
Get in.

454
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:22,263
Get in.

455
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:39,454
Let's go.
