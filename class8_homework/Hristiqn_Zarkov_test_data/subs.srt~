1
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,507
When are
we gonna tell everybody

2
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:18,875
about our wedding?

3
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:20,076
Oh, we're not.

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,111
Not till we make
all the plans, okay?

5
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:23,379
Whoa-ho!

6
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:24,914
All right.

7
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:27,784
Oh, this guy is
all chewed up.

8
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,919
Torn, actually.

9
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:32,688
Missing phalanges, bone
fragments from the skull.

10
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:34,624
Probably a hawk
fed on him.

11
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:37,126
Don't you want to discuss it
with our friends, Booth?

12
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:39,462
Oh, really? I mean, you really
want to get everyone's opinion

13
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:41,397
on what they think
our wedding should be like?

14
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,932
What, "You can't
have pigs in a blanket," huh?

15
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,367
"No, no, you know what,
you should have

16
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,802
"radishes that are
shaped like hummingbirds

17
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,103
and wear dandelion hats."

18
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:48,571
I've never even
seen those things.

19
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:50,139
They exist.

20
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:52,141
Based on decomp,
I'd estimate

21
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:53,943
he's been here for
approximately three days.

22
00:00:53,977 --> 00:00:56,245
But Cam should probably
make that determination.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,815
We can wait for her
to get a definitive...

24
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:00,449
No, no, no.
We're not...

25
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:02,084
I've been dangling here
for long enough, all right?

26
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,619
Things are... you know,
they're starting to pinch.

27
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:06,155
Listen, Bones, all I'm saying,
that this is...

28
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,057
Look, we've been
waiting a long time

29
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:10,226
for this day,
for our wedding, all right?

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,994
I just want this
to be our day. Don't you?

31
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:13,563
But we'll invite
everybody, won't we?

32
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:15,298
Of course.
Of course we are.

33
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:16,365
You always say
that you know best.

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,700
Based on the
palatine suture,

35
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,702
the width of the
ascending ramus

36
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:22,405
and the sternal
rib ends,

37
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,275
the victim was a Caucasian
male in his early 50s.

38
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,810
I do dislike it

39
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:29,157
when other people
tell me what to do.

40
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:31,480
See? Now there's the Bones
that I love, all right?

41
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:32,481
We're gonna have
a great wedding.

42
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:34,383
Whoo... all right.

43
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:35,418
What are you doing?

44
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:36,886
Aw...
That's right.

45
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,921
Or whatever it's gonna be.
Okay.

46
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:40,489
But... pigs
in a blanket?

47
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:42,124
Yeah. Pigs in a blanket.

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,392
It's God's perfect food.

49
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:45,828
That might be
a point of contention.

50
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:47,496
Come on.

51
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:48,931
This looks like
an accident.

52
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,366
Oh, no.
No one out of shape

53
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,301
in their 50s, goes
rock climbing alone.

54
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:53,232
This was a murder.

55
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:54,804
You're making an
assumption, Booth.

56
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:56,038
What?
Well, I'm that guy.

57
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,273
I'm that gut guy, okay?

58
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:58,708
I assume things.
That's what I do.

59
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:01,544
Whoa!

60
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,212
Then I'm going
to need to take

61
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:04,780
the hawk back to
the lab, too.

62
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:06,549
Is he eating a finger?

63
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,218
Yes. He seems to be enjoying it.

64
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,154
We'll need
Animal Control.

65
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,258
No, we need to get
pulled up.

66
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,526
Hey! Can we
get the hawk?

67
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:20,696
Trust me, you're gonna like
pigs in a blanket.

68
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:28,070
So I'm compiling character
traits of rock climbers

69
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,605
and their psychosocial...
Great.

70
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,440
You don't want to hear?
Oh, I get it.

71
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:32,875
Psycho socials--
they're like dances,

72
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,443
uh, you know,
in a loony bin.

73
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:36,112
I got it, right?
Come on in.

74
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:37,413
Shut the door, will you?

75
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,015
Just... will you
shut the door for a second?

76
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:40,049
What's going on?
Thanks.

77
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,183
I just want to...

78
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:42,818
want you to...

79
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,327
just keep an open mind
about something here.

80
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,954
About what?

81
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,856
Is this about the wedding?
'Cause if you want

82
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,824
to parachute from a plane or something,
No.

83
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:50,393
I'm down. I'll do it.

84
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:53,296
No one's parachuting
from a-a plane.

85
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,797
Thank God.
You know, I actually

86
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:56,511
have an awesome idea for a wedding.
Sweets.

87
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,402
It's not about,
um, the wedding.

88
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:00,603
It's about VAL.

89
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:03,172
Who's that?
No. No. No.

90
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:05,286
Because my last blind date
was a disaster, all right?

91
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,176
She threw her drink
my ce because

92
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,145
she didn't know what "masticate" meant.
This isn't a...

93
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,514
It means to chew.
Sweets, just pay attention, okay?

94
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:14,348
she didn't know what "masticate" meant.
I'd like to introduce you to...

95
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:17,787
...VAL.

96
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:20,523
Okay?
It's a Virtual something...

97
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:22,358
Adumbrative.
Yes!

98
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:23,826
That's the word.

99
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,328
It's an artificial
profiling system.

100
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,595
Right. You know...

101
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,197
So everything I get
from the case,

102
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:31,233
I got to input it into here
and so do the squints, so...

103
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:32,568
Wow.

104
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,403
They want to compare me
to a computer.

105
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:36,105
I can't be replaced
by a video game.

106
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:38,574
Listen, I had to... I just
felt like I had to tell you.

107
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:39,675
Right? Because you're...

108
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,410
you know... so I did.

109
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:43,045
But if you tell anyone,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

110
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,280
No, I understand.

111
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:45,982
This is not
a problem, it's...

112
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:47,583
it's a joke, is what...

113
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:49,218
I-I agree.
It's a complete joke.

114
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,953
Yeah.
To me, it's like that Russian guy

115
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:52,288
who played the computer
in chess.

116
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:53,322
It doesn't work.

117
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:55,524
Exactly.

118
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:59,261
Kasparov lost to
the computer, but...

119
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:03,265
it's not a... it's not
a good comparison.

120
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:07,269
Oh.

121
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,407
What a beautiful bird.

122
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:13,242
I know, right?

123
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:15,878
And look how much
he's regurgitated.

124
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:17,013
Excuse me?

125
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:18,514
Yeah.

126
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,149
See, hawks, they don't
have teeth, right?

127
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,418
So they got to tear
and swallow clothes,

128
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:24,754
flesh and bone whole,
and then they regurgitate

129
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:26,022
what they can't,
you know, digest.

130
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,490
This guy is full
of evidence.

131
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:28,791
I mean, look at this.

132
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,559
Honey, when you're
showing me puke,

133
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:33,229
don't smile like that.
It's called rangle.

134
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:35,097
See, when the stomach
contents come up,

135
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:37,700
they're this hard, congealed...
Okay. I get it.

136
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,769
I'm starting to feel like
I'm gonna rangle.

137
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:44,807
Come on, buddy.

138
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,545
Have you examined
these X-rays, Dr. Wells?

139
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,447
Of course.
I took them.

140
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:54,450
Lack of extensions along
the edges of the phalanges

141
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:56,318
where the flexor
sheath attaches

142
00:04:56,353 --> 00:04:58,287
and an absence of
remodeled stress

143
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:01,390
or other fractures in
the wrists and metacarpals

144
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:04,260
indicate someone who has not
been rock climbing before.

145
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:05,694
You shouldn't be reading,
Dr. Wells.

146
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,463
I'm sorry. Was I wrong?

147
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:08,597
That's beside the point.

148
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:10,099
You're here to work, not read.

149
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,634
Based on decomp

150
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,335
and the desiccation
of the tissue,

151
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,037
I'd estimate time of death at...

152
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:16,439
Three days.

153
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:18,007
Excuse me?
Three days.

154
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,176
I factored in ambient
temperature at the scene,

155
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,011
rainfall, the feeding
of the carrion...

156
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:24,346
I-I'm sorry, but if you
were gonna say anything

157
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:26,515
other than three days,
you'd be wrong.

158
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,883
Now, can I just
finish my page?

159
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:29,685
No.

160
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,927
Oh, my God.

161
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,064
Why am I never prepared
for what I see here?

162
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:44,400
Alfred Adler would say that a
repression of visual stimuli...

163
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:46,102
Why is he back?

164
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,770
He's brilliant.

165
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:49,772
Is that why he's reading
Mindy Kaling's book?

166
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,740
I'm a polymath.

167
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,375
I can learn from anything.

168
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,743
How long will it take you

169
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,378
to do a facial
reconstruction?

170
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:58,047
Uh, damaged skull and
the dried tissue...

171
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:59,515
The sooner
the better, really,

172
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:01,717
because this dude was
definitely murdered.

173
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:03,252
I think it's a little bit early

174
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:04,720
to make that statement,
Dr. Wells.

175
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:06,555
Perhaps not.

176
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,791
The facial injuries
indicate that the victim

177
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:10,426
struck the cliff face first.

178
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,261
As if he were thrown off

179
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:13,562
the edge of the cliff,
as Booth assumed.

180
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,131
Well, then there's also

181
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:17,933
hemorrhagic staining to
the wound around the parietal,

182
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:21,504
which means
it occurred perimortem.

183
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:23,606
So the wound to the parietal
was cause of death.

184
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,107
Yes. The victim was
bludgeoned to death

185
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:27,176
before going over
the side of that cliff.

186
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,544
Now...

187
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:29,979
can I finish my page?

188
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,917
I'll take that as a "yes."

189
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:41,239

192
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:11,978
I disagree.

193
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:13,980
I'm just telling you
what VAL says.

194
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,982
And how exactly does VAL
tell you these things?

195
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:18,652
Oh, well, if I'm not in my
office, you know, she texts me.

196
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:20,053
Look at that.

197
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:21,488
"Perpetrator is
an experienced rock climber."

198
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:23,256
I disagree.
So does the Jeffersonian.

199
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,392
Noted, Sweets.
Okay? Just relax.

200
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:28,061
Okay, can we please stop
calling it "her" and "she"?

201
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:29,796
I mean...
Yeah.

202
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:32,833
So why don't you think
the murderer is a climber?

203
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:35,035
No, I don't think that the
killer isn't a climber,

204
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,204
I just think it's
crazy to say that

205
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,473
he's an experienced
rock climber.

206
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:40,907
There's a difference.
Okay.

207
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:42,375
You're agreeing with me,
which, you know...

208
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,044
which is good.
I like it.

209
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:46,346
So, our victim is
an amateur,

210
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,381
he's vulnerable in
dangerous situations.

211
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,450
He goes climbing with
someone who bashes him.

212
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:52,886
While he's suiting up,
or whatever they call it.

213
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,521
Good enough. And then
he tosses him over the edge

214
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:55,755
and makes it
look like an accident.

215
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,692
Did VAL tell you that?

216
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:00,460
I don't think so.

217
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,904
The victim exhibited bilateral
intercondylar fractures

218
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,639
to the distal ends
of the femurs.

219
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:15,775
Interesting, Dr. Wells, but
irrelevant for cause of death.

220
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,677
Well, seeing as
how it occurred

221
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:20,113
four months before the
victim died, I get it.

222
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:21,414
Keep your shirt on.

223
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,817
Dr. Wells,
you are an intern.

224
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:25,919
Please treat Dr. Brennan
with the respect she's due.

225
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:27,202
Well, I thought
this was a meritocracy.

226
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:27,845
It is.

227
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,870
Then that <i>was</i>
the respect she's due.

228
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:32,225
No, no, it wasn't.
And since she's your...

229
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,560
Don't say "superior."
...boss.

230
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:34,928
But I will say
"superior" if I want,

231
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,097
because I am also
your superior.

232
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,398
Do you understand?

233
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:40,834
So, Dr. Brennan,
have you set a date yet?

234
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:42,435
For the wedding.

235
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,638
Oh, we aren't adjusting
for anyone's schedule.

236
00:08:44,672 --> 00:08:47,741
If you have a conflict
and would like to attend,

237
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,342
you'll have to rearrange
your schedule.

238
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:51,011
Okay.

239
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,445
That's a warm invitation.

240
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:54,447
Concise,

241
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,283
to the point.
Well said. Bravo.

242
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:57,217
Thank you.

243
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:58,418
I took a slide

244
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,086
from the victim's liver,

245
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,022
and as you can see...
Cancerous.

246
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:03,323
Quite advanced.

247
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:04,424
Our victim was terminal.

248
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,992
Could you please see
if Angela has...

249
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,061
Made any progress
on identifying the victim. Yes.

250
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,596
Must you interrupt?

251
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,598
I'm just trying to use
our time efficiently.

252
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,436
Well, it doesn't make you
any more likeable.

253
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,306
Is likability important?

254
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,541
Right now, I'm gonna
go with "yes."

255
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:25,478
How can you do
a facial reconstruction

256
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:27,614
without any tissue markers?

257
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:29,416
Well, I'm extrapolating
the missing fragments

258
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,884
based on
the general characteristics

259
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,385
of a Caucasian skull.

260
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,120
Now I'm gonna run this
against the DMV database

261
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:35,622
and see what
we come up with.

262
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:36,990
The use of
a generic skull

263
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,425
is gonna result
in far too many hits.

264
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,194
You don't have
many friends, do you?

265
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:42,596
No, I don't.

266
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,030
None, really.

267
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:45,966
Hmm. That's a shocker.

268
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
This is a waste
of time.

269
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:50,837
Wow, look at that.

270
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:53,039
One match. Who knew?

271
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:54,574
I suppose you think
your little ding

272
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:55,609
taught me a lesson.

273
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,977
Did it?

274
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,144
Yes.

275
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,380
Never discount
random luck.

276
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,756
Having terminal cancer...
it's not good.

277
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,925
"Terminal" means end point.

278
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,093
The end. Death.

279
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:14,494
And you know what?

280
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:15,762
Life is better than death.

281
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:17,097
That's deep.

282
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,632
I don't think so.

283
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,200
But impending death
bestows a gift

284
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:21,434
I did not see coming.

285
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:23,670
Clarity.
That's so true.

286
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:25,372
Knowing the end is near
lends a bittersweet urgency

287
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:28,208
to every breath, every moment.

288
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:29,509
And you know what else?

289
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:30,944
Fear evaporates.

290
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,212
This is our victim?

291
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:33,413
That's him.

292
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:34,447
Charlie McCord.

293
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:36,182
There you go.
Take a good look.

294
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:41,054
High school principal,
married, two kids.

295
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,355
What is this video?
Well, you know,

296
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,024
when he found out
that he was gonna die,

297
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:45,859
he made all these videos,
he created this Web site

298
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,527
where you can buy them;
they're incredibly popular.

299
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,463
It's not uncommon for people
to ascribe special wisdom

300
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:52,032
to those who are
facing death.

301
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:54,000
That's because
they have special wisdom.

302
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:55,935
Watch, watch.

303
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,737
And fear is what stands

304
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:59,539
between us and fulfillment.

305
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:00,940
Once fear is gone,

306
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:03,443
life opens up
to all its grandeur.

307
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:04,944
All things are possible.

308
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:07,313
This guy's deep.

309
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,985
Why do you need
our victim's ear canal?

310
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,219
Oh, yes.

311
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:15,455
I want to analyze
the cerumen.

312
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:17,390
The earwax?

313
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:19,426
It's less icky
if I call it cerumen.

314
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,760
Look at this.

315
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:22,595
It builds up like sediment.

316
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,198
You can track his recent
activities through earwax?

317
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:27,500
Cerumen.
And even though

318
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:29,636
he snacks on dead humans,
he's not a buzzard.

319
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,004
He's a hawk, Cam.

320
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:33,640
Hey, he's a hawk.

321
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:39,345
Hey, labels are important,
you know?

322
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,981
'Cause words can hurt.

323
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:45,318
<i>I can't believe Charlie's dead.</i>

324
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:47,087
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

325
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:48,755
Four days ago.

326
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:50,824
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt your husband?

327
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,692
Uh, no.

328
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:54,227
I-I mean,

329
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:57,163
there were some comments
underneath his videos

330
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:58,631
that were pretty mean.

331
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,467
People who said
that he was stupid,

332
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,202
or that he was
faking his illness

333
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:03,303
to make money, but...

334
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,637
You found Charlie

335
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:06,139
climbing a cliff?

336
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:07,474
Is that strange?

337
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,109
Well, he was afraid of heights.

338
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,744
"Well, when fear is gone,

339
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:13,079
life opens up all its grandeur."

340
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:15,715
You've seen one of his videos.

341
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,083
Yeah, well, he was a wise man.

342
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:18,585
He was hoping maybe

343
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:20,153
someone would see them
and pay us

344
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,554
for the rights to write a book.

345
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:22,922
Turns out,
people are willing

346
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,457
to buy them
the way they are.

347
00:12:24,492 --> 00:12:25,959
It's typical.

348
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:27,527
Charlie's dying,

349
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:29,896
and he's worrying
about me and the kids.

350
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:34,334
I'm sorry, wasn't he in pain?

351
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:35,368
Constantly.

352
00:12:35,402 --> 00:12:36,636
The autopsy didn't show

353
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,272
any narcotics in his system.

354
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,141
Charlie wanted to put off drugs
for as long as he could.

355
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:44,444
He would only take
homeopathic medicine.

356
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:47,080
He was a wonderful man.

357
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,782
Anyone who knew him

358
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:52,685
would tell you
that he was special.

359
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,427
I recovered several videos
from the victim's cell phone,

360
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:04,397
one of which you'll find
extremely interesting.

361
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:06,032
One of his "live
life to the fullest

362
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:07,534
'cause life is
too short" videos?

363
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:08,668
Uh, not exactly.

364
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:10,403
This was time-stamped

365
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:12,605
five days before
the murder.

366
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,908
Hey, Chuck, Chuck.

367
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,277
Hey, man, big fan.

368
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,346
What?

369
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,582
Obviously, somebody took
this video.

370
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:24,117
Wow, that hurt.

371
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:29,455
Pull over!

372
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,690
Hey, pull over!

373
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,192
He's mad.

374
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:35,061
That was
incredibly cowardly.

375
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:36,729
Well...
Come on, Angela,

376
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,299
how much courage does it take
to sucker punch someone?

377
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,467
A lot when it's this guy.

378
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:43,837
Oh, my God.

379
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:47,540
Yeah, this is Chuck
"The Iceman" Liddell.

380
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:50,043
He's a mixed martial arts
world champion.

381
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:52,612
So, Charlie McCord slugged
the toughest man in the world?

382
00:13:52,646 --> 00:13:54,080
Yeah.

383
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:57,550
And revenge is sort of
the Iceman's thing.

384
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:06,400
Pull over!

385
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:07,501
Hey, pull over!

386
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:08,702
He's mad.

387
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:10,307
Yeah, that's me.
So what?

388
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,908
Getting punched in the face
a crime now?

389
00:14:11,943 --> 00:14:13,176
No, murder was the crime.

390
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,611
This guy was murdered
four days ago.

391
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,679
You think I did it?

392
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:16,780
Look at you, huh?

393
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,181
Looks like you're mad enough.

394
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,183
People come up to me
all the time.

395
00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:23,286
Sign an autograph,
take a picture with them.

396
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,155
I don't get punched
in the face for it.

397
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:26,356
So you're saying
you never saw him before?

398
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,857
Not till Charlie
threw the punch.

399
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,359
Wait, then how do you know
his name?

400
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:31,027
He called me after.
Apparently,

401
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,029
I was on his bucket list--
you know, a list of stuff

402
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:35,298
you want to do before you die?
So let me get this straight.

403
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,668
Uh, "punch the Iceman"
was on his bucket list?

404
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,604
Yeah, I was kind of flattered
when I heard.

405
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:42,272
He's a nice guy.

406
00:14:42,306 --> 00:14:43,873
Really sorry to hear
what happened.

407
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:46,876
Uh, let me know
if there's anything I can do.

408
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:54,718
There's evidence that the finger

409
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:56,886
was treated after he
slugged the Iceman.

410
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:58,121
That's the least
of his worries.

411
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,756
He only had six weeks
to live.

412
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,926
There are so many variables
to an assessment like that

413
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,628
that it is practically guessing.

414
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:07,564
But if McCord was told
he only had six weeks,

415
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:10,300
that would explain
his risk-taking.

416
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,068
Would it not,
Dr. Know-it-all?

417
00:15:12,103 --> 00:15:13,503
I will concede that.

418
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,605
That's mighty big of you.

419
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,940
What's this?

420
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:18,541
I was thinking about

421
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:21,177
the victim's bucket list,
so I made one for you.

422
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,779
'Cause we all
need one, right?

423
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:24,814
"Number one, don't be a douche.

424
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:26,082
"Number two, really,

425
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:27,584
"don't be a douche.

426
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:29,953
"Number three, work and
play well with others

427
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:31,855
so I'm not perceived
as a douche."

428
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,556
Do I have to read all ten?

429
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,792
Probably not.
You think it's easy

430
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:37,027
being superior?

431
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:38,862
It's a curse, I assure you.

432
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,296
Mostly for us.

433
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:42,932
There must be a heart in
there someplace, Oliver.

434
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:45,001
I'm just trying to
help; it's tough love.

435
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:48,338
It's misguided,
but I understand.

436
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,641
I don't even think
he had six weeks.

437
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:52,809
Look at this.

438
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:54,811
The cancer was spreading
to his bones.

439
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:57,213
Look at the marrow;
see how porous it is?

440
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,482
Yeah, he was never
gonna finish his list.

441
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:01,017
Poor guy.

442
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:03,019
Murdered before he had
a chance to die.

443
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,654
Sad.

444
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:07,457
Really?
Yeah.

445
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:09,959
I mean, we all want
a little more time, don't we?

446
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:12,796
To fix things, to go out with
our ducks in a row.

447
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,831
Check his medical records,
see if you can

448
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,800
find out who treated his finger.

449
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,169
Maybe that will lead to
who shot the cell phone video.

450
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:20,537
Okay.

451
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:26,342
Computer profiling
is absurd, okay?

452
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:29,913
Psychology takes, um, subtlety
and a subjective analysis.

453
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,247
Subjective?
Yeah.

454
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,882
Well, that's the problem.

455
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:37,153
A computer program with
advanced analytical algorithms

456
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:39,189
would not be subjective;
it would skirt

457
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:40,623
the pitfalls of Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.

458
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:42,258
So you're saying

459
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,253
after all we've been through,
you think a computer

460
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,528
would be better than me?

461
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:46,930
Theoretically, yes.

462
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,732
Hey, how's it going?

463
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,433
How's it going?
I'll tell you how it's going.

464
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,670
Dr. Brennan would rather
work with a computer than me.

465
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:56,873
But as a lunch companion,
I certainly prefer you.

466
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,241
You know what,
that's high praise, Sweets.

467
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,715
Anyhow, VAL says
that the bucket list

468
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:00,844
shows that the victim was--

469
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:02,178
uh, let's see, it says here--

470
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,947
"vulnerable because
of his illness.

471
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,649
"The guise of him as a
sincerely good man is a mask

472
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,318
to hide his anger
and hostility."

473
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,420
That's stupid.

474
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:11,454
That's lame psycho-babble.

475
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,655
Stupid. I hope they didn't

476
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,424
spend too much on that program.

477
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,658
I heard three million.

478
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:17,260
- What?
- Three million dollars?

479
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:19,329
I...
And they can't give me a raise.

480
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:21,397
You know, I'm seriously
like Call of Duty,

481
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:23,233
and-and that thing is like

482
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:24,968
Elf Bowling.
All right,

483
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,003
show me what you got
there, Mr. Call of Duty.

484
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:29,539
I've analyzed Charlie's videos;
he's a genuinely good man.

485
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:31,674
The essence of a bucket list
isn't vulnerability.

486
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,910
It's rooted
in the simple human desire

487
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:36,780
to realize one's potential
before death.

488
00:17:36,814 --> 00:17:38,414
I buy that.
You know what,

489
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:40,250
computer zero, Sweets one.
Good work, you're back.

490
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,551
Thank you.

491
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:43,286
VAL is a moron, all right?

492
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,321
Everyone has some kind
of a bucket list.

493
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,157
I don't have a list, per se.

494
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,726
Well, winning the
Nobel, of course,

495
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,028
but that's more
of an eventuality than a dream.

496
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,163
I've got, like,

497
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,531
a million things on my list.

498
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:55,465
Really?

499
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:56,933
If you could pick one?

500
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,101
All right, um, you know the guy

501
00:17:58,135 --> 00:17:59,415
who did the free-fall
from space?

502
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:01,204
ah.
Yeah.

503
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:04,440
I'd like to buy him a drink.

504
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:05,575
That...

505
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:06,976
That's...

506
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:08,344
Okay.

507
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,979
Brennan.

508
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,648
Hi, Angela.

509
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:13,716
You don't want to free-fall?
Yes.

510
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:15,084
Who? All right.

511
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,187
Yes, Booth is here;
I'll tell him.

512
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:20,623
Angela got
the victim's medical records.

513
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:22,759
His wife wasn't listed
as the emergency contact

514
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:25,061
for any of
his hospital stays.

515
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:26,963
It was a man
named Martin Proctor.

516
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:28,231
So the victim
might not have trusted

517
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:29,666
his wife as much as we thought.

518
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,678
Are you busy?

519
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,012
Hey.

520
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:44,447
Is something wrong?

521
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:45,815
Wrong? No, I don't think so.

522
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,850
Is there?

523
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:47,917
I-I don't know.

524
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,319
You seem like you want to talk.

525
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:50,553
I do.

526
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,654
Is that wrong?

527
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:53,223
No, I...

528
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,991
Forget it.

529
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:56,426
No, I-I'm not busy, no.

530
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,861
Good.

531
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:00,396
You remember that I'm going
to marry Booth?

532
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,299
I vaguely recollect that, yeah.

533
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:08,271
Oh, no.

534
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:11,074
He didn't call it off again,
did he?

535
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,309
Because I can do
physical harm.

536
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:14,811
No, no.

537
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,779
We've just decided

538
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:19,449
that we don't want anyone else
to help us plan our wedding.

539
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:21,784
Oh.
Guests will be that, just guests.

540
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,487
And if they don't like
pigs in blankets,

541
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:26,489
they may have to bring
their own snacks.

542
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:29,192
Booth and I haven't figured out
all the details yet.

543
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,461
I don't care how
or where you do it, sweetie.

544
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:34,530
I got married in a jail cell,
for God's sake.

545
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,102
Booth is a good man, Angela.

546
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,604
He didn't want to hurt me.

547
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,172
It was Pelant who kept us apart.

548
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:46,342
Until he was gone,
Booth's hands were tied.

549
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:49,512
Yeah, I should've
trusted him, huh?

550
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,781
Yes.

551
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,850
But it was hard

552
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:56,786
for me, too, at the time.

553
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,390
Well, listen,
whatever you two decide,

554
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:02,659
I'm sure it's gonna be perfect.

555
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:04,494
I'm not gonna
say another word.

556
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:07,263
That will make Booth very happy.

557
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:10,967
Listen, I was hoping to help
with the dress, though.

558
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,969
I just don't want
you ending up

559
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,004
in a grass skirt
and a headdress.

560
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,840
And that will make me
very happy.

561
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,075
And isn't that

562
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:20,410
what a matron of honor

563
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:22,045
is supposed to do?

564
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,980
Oh, my God.

565
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,052
Thank you.

566
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:30,720
It's "maid of honor."

567
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:33,556
Well, technically,
you're married, so it's matron.

568
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:38,261
Usually, we'd expect to see
his wife listed

569
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:39,495
as the emergency contact.

570
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,097
Charlie couldn't do that.

571
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:42,765
He didn't want his wife
to worry.

572
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,201
You were helping him
with his bucket list.

573
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:47,603
Was. It was
getting too crazy.

574
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:49,505
I told him if he was
gonna kill himself,

575
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,007
I wouldn't be a part of it.

576
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,108
What was your relationship
with Charlie?

577
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,309
I blew my shoulder out

578
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:54,978
pitching when I was
a student here.

579
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:56,379
Torn rotator cuff.

580
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:58,681
A couple years ago,
before Charlie got sick,

581
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,350
he got me a job in
the IT department.

582
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,786
Then he set me up as coach
of the baseball team, too.

583
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:05,521
Oh, wow, so he was like
a father figure to you.

584
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,323
Yeah.

585
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:08,958
And you helped him

586
00:21:08,993 --> 00:21:10,026
video his lectures?

587
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,160
Edit them, too.

588
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:13,229
Charlie and I...

589
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:14,530
we were tight.

590
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,332
Even working on this
charity together,

591
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:18,134
Quarters for Care.

592
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:19,569
Where were you four days ago?

593
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:23,106
Uh, what are you...
what are you saying?

594
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,907
Nothing, just doing my job.

595
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:26,876
Yeah.

596
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:29,779
Yeah, sorry.

597
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:34,350
Uh, four days ago...

598
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,754
Batting practice in the morning,

599
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:40,390
and then went to a movie
at Wheaton Plaza.

600
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,291
I think I still have
the ticket stub.

601
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:46,562
Charlie always said
I was too fussy.

602
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,665
It's okay, but do you have
a copy of his bucket list?

603
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,235
Um...

604
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,740
Charlie didn't want Linda
to see the list.

605
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,642
There are only two left:
"go rock climbing

606
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:01,044
and make Lena whole."

607
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:03,413
Okay, um, who's Lena?

608
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,647
Lena Silver.

609
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:06,649
She was a bookkeeper
for the school.

610
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:08,317
Charlie caught her cheating,

611
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:10,486
turned her in; she
wound up going to jail.

612
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:11,988
Charlie felt pretty bad
about it,

613
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:13,356
so he was tracking her down.

614
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,058
You think she wanted revenge?

615
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,692
She always seemed nice.

616
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:19,128
But she lost everything
when she went to jail.

617
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:21,230
Even her kids.

618
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:29,457
Oh, come on.

619
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:30,624
You have VAL, too?

620
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,126
I'm not supposed to tell you.

621
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,828
Yeah, no, neither was Booth.

622
00:22:33,862 --> 00:22:35,329
Thanks.

623
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:37,064
So, what you should
be hearing

624
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:39,467
is that we prefer you
to Optimus Prime here.

625
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:40,568
Who says...

626
00:22:40,602 --> 00:22:41,936
Oh, VAL told you something, huh?

627
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,105
According to VAL,

628
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:46,474
someone named Lena Silver
is our prime suspect,

629
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:49,477
with an 86% chance
she committed the murder.

630
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:51,011
Do you even know
who that is?

631
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:53,013
Yeah. Lena Silver was
the bookkeeper

632
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:54,648
for the victim's school.

633
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:57,084
He reported her for
embezzling $6,000,

634
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,487
she lost her job,
went to jail, lost her kids.

635
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:01,455
Went to jail for six grand?
Yeah.

636
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,390
Ensuing investigations uncovered
other thefts, so...

637
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,426
Sounds like a motive.

638
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,162
Could you be 86% certain
without any proof?

639
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:09,363
No.
No.

640
00:23:09,397 --> 00:23:10,798
VAL is, huh?

641
00:23:10,832 --> 00:23:12,099
No one's even talked
to the woman yet.

642
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:13,567
I hate VAL.

643
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:14,969
She is stupid.

644
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,270
I hate her.
"It."

645
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:17,371
You hate "it."

646
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:18,739
You might as well hate

647
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,141
a transistor radio.

648
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,912
We're all on
your side, Sweets.

649
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,313
Yeah.

650
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:38,492
Whoa.

651
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:40,828
Um, should you
be doing that?

652
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:43,030
Well, I figure if I
hurry up and feed him,

653
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:46,000
maybe he'll hurry up and rangle
the last bit of evidence.

654
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:48,435
Hey, I got results
from Charlie's ears.

655
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,004
So, cerumen, right,

656
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,007
it accumulates at a rate
of .01 millimeters per day.

657
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,176
Now, this...

658
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,744
Ooh, no, nope.
Sorry, not that.

659
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:57,878
Your bucket list?

660
00:23:57,913 --> 00:24:00,314
Yeah, yeah,
I got inspired.

661
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:02,149
I got to check out Area 51,
you know?

662
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:03,984
I mean, the real one,
not the fake one

663
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:05,419
they pawn off
on tourists.

664
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:06,620
Can't die without that.

665
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:07,621
Earwax?

666
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,924
Right.

667
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,492
Yuck.

668
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:13,093
All that was in his ear?

669
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:15,496
Mm-hmm. .02 millimeters in,
I found acetylene black,

670
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,631
polyisoprene, halobutyl,
sulfide,

671
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,768
nylon, copper, sulphur
and steel particulates.

672
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:22,436
Okay, so sulphur,
copper sulfide--

673
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,738
sounds like he was sleeping
with a chemistry set.

674
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,073
Tires.
Tires?

675
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:27,541
Pyrolysis.

676
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:29,577
Pyrolysis is

677
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:31,145
the thermochemical
decomposition of materials

678
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,680
in the absence of oxygen.

679
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:35,382
He was at
a tire recycling facility?

680
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:38,452
Yep. And based on the depth
of the chemicals

681
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:40,521
in the cerumen,
two days before he died.

682
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:43,257
Angie could only find one
in the tri-state area.

683
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,458
"Riley's Tire Depot."

684
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:46,026
Mm-hmm.

685
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:48,896
They have absolutely no
record of Charlie buying,

686
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,765
selling or dropping off tires
in the last couple weeks.

687
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,368
I'll tell Booth.

688
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:58,606
Did I see that you wanted
to be shot out of a cannon?

689
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,740
You don't?

690
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:02,243
But first,
I want to leap

691
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:04,445
from the top of the Jungfrau
wearing one of those

692
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,280
Rocky the Flying Squirrel suits,
you know?

693
00:25:06,314 --> 00:25:07,581
Of course you do.

694
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:09,116
Hey, but that's
just the tip of

695
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,985
the iceberg, you know?
What about you?

696
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:14,355
Oh, I...

697
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,824
just want a villa in Tuscany

698
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:19,293
where I can drink wine
and make love.

699
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:20,828
That's it?

700
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:22,596
Lot of wine and a lot of love.

701
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:28,202
And not seeing a bird barf.

702
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,838
Ooh, rangle time.

703
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:33,574
I can cross this off my list.

704
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:35,776
I was able to reconstruct
the skull

705
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,279
with fragments
that the bird barfed up.

706
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:39,780
The fracture
to the parietal

707
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:42,182
would have caused
the dura mater to be torn.

708
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:43,484
Very good, Dr. Brennan.

709
00:25:43,518 --> 00:25:45,819
I say "very good," Dr. Wells.

710
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,488
Not you.

711
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:50,157
Why can't I verbally recognize
your small triumphs?

712
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:52,526
I don't know.

713
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,395
Note the series

714
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,797
of radiating
depression fractures.

715
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,199
Normally, radiating fractures
on a skull terminate

716
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:01,368
when they encounter
a previous fracture.

717
00:26:01,403 --> 00:26:03,504
The fractures
on this skull all overlap

718
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:06,173
as if they happened
at the same time.

719
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,175
The wound has
characteristics

720
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:10,044
of an injury occurring
from one blow

721
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:12,112
and multiple blows.

722
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:13,714
The evidence contradicts itself.

723
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:16,250
So we still don't know
what the murder weapon was?

724
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,585
He was either struck
three times or once.

725
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,020
How can it be both?

726
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:23,324
So it's really
a philosophical question.

727
00:26:23,358 --> 00:26:24,725
No, Dr. Wells, it isn't.

728
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:27,528
Because it actually happened.

729
00:26:27,562 --> 00:26:30,030
<i>Most of the people I look up to</i>

730
00:26:30,065 --> 00:26:33,867
have taken great risks,
both personal and professional.

731
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:37,838
Real growth comes from
taking chances.

732
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:39,373
That's true.

733
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:40,908
Well, he must be right,

734
00:26:40,942 --> 00:26:43,010
because Charlie McCord
was doing a great business

735
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:44,812
off these videos
before he died.

736
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:46,480
Two bucks a pop.

737
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:48,148
Wow. And after he died?

738
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:49,516
With that publicity?

739
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:51,251
Thousands of downloads an hour.

740
00:26:51,286 --> 00:26:54,655
The wife will clean up
if it keeps going at this rate.

741
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,290
Another motive.

742
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:02,396
You know what?
Maybe VAL is right.

743
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,897
I mean,
Lena Silver lives

744
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:05,933
right next to
Riley's Tire Depot.

745
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:07,634
Do you have a tuxedo?

746
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,837
No. Oh, you mean
for the wedding?

747
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:10,871
Yes.

748
00:27:10,905 --> 00:27:12,239
Ah. No, do I need one?

749
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:14,308
Well, if I will be wearing
a wedding dress,

750
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,976
we'd look more like
we belong together

751
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,378
if you're wearing a tuxedo.

752
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:19,380
Like we're standing
on top of a cake.

753
00:27:19,414 --> 00:27:20,914
Yes.
With frosting down below.

754
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:22,316
Yeah.
Ah!

755
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,151
Okay, I'll get a tuxedo.
And shiny shoes.

756
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,386
So we're going formal?

757
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,755
Yes, yes, in a church.
Your church.

758
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,623
I've-I've studied
the ceremony.

759
00:27:29,657 --> 00:27:30,824
It's beautiful.

760
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,259
Even the superstitions.

761
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:33,494
You sure?

762
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,596
It would make you happy,
wouldn't it?

763
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,898
So, then it'll
make me happy, too.

764
00:27:37,932 --> 00:27:40,601
Tell you what, if we weren't
waiting for a murder suspect to

765
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:43,170
open up that door,
I would take you in my arms...

766
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,772
Whoa, okay! Oh-oh, easy.

767
00:27:44,806 --> 00:27:47,007
FBI, okay?
Put the weapon down.

768
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,276
Sorry.
It's a tough neighborhood.

769
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,644
Are you Lena Silver?

770
00:27:50,678 --> 00:27:52,646
Yes.
Booth, isn't that a violation

771
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,082
of her parole to have
a weapon that could have

772
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:56,784
been used to kill
Charlie McCord?

773
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:59,119
Okay, we're gonna have
to take you into custody, Lena.

774
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,038
You must have been very angry
at Charlie, Miss Silver.

775
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:06,413
He ruined your life.

776
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:07,981
No, he didn't.
I did.

777
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:10,083
When he turned me in,
Charlie didn't know

778
00:28:10,117 --> 00:28:11,351
I had two prior arrests.

779
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,686
Was I gonna blame him
for that, too?

780
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:17,023
So he got you arrested,
and you thanked him?

781
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:19,059
At the time,
I wanted to kill him.

782
00:28:19,093 --> 00:28:21,795
But that was before
I went into counseling.

783
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:26,066
And to be honest,
before I saw Charlie's videos.

784
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,600
So after watching Charlie,
you learned to

785
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:30,203
accept your situation
and forgive yourself?

786
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:31,871
Is there something wrong
with that?

787
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:34,207
No, I think
it's very impressive.

788
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:37,644
Bitterness and anger aren't
gonna help me build a new life.

789
00:28:37,678 --> 00:28:40,980
Or get your kids back.

790
00:28:41,015 --> 00:28:44,150
And killing Charlie wouldn't
help get my kids back either.
Hristiqn_Zarkov_1.rb

791
00:28:44,185 --> 00:28:45,465
No, but sometimes we don't think

792
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:46,820
of all the consequences
before we act.

793
00:28:46,854 --> 00:28:49,389
People can change, Dr. Sweets.

794
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:51,057
I'm proof of that.

795
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:52,559
And when I get my kids back,

796
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:54,394
they're gonna have a mom
they can be proud of.

797
00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:56,563
We can place Charlie
near your house

798
00:28:56,597 --> 00:28:58,131
around the time of his death.

799
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:00,033
I'm gone most of the day.

800
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:01,634
I'm working
two minimum wage jobs.

801
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:04,604
And when I sleep,
I don't hear a thing.

802
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:07,240
We're gonna have to hold you
until we test the pipe

803
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:09,042
to see if it's
the murder weapon.

804
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:13,980
I'd do the same thing
if I were you.

805
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,924
<i>Let's be clear.</i>

806
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,861
We're all riding in a boat
that's destined to sink.

807
00:29:27,895 --> 00:29:30,063
It's the journey
that gives our lives meaning.

808
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:32,966
We're all flawed.
We could all be better.

809
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,935
But focusing on the negatives,
it merely makes us negative.

810
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,071
My life will be over soon.

811
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:40,573
But I'm not afraid.

812
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:42,408
I'm grateful.

813
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:45,111
Probably not grateful
to be murdered.

814
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:46,913
He was a wonderful man.

815
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:49,082
These videos will probably help
a lot of people.

816
00:29:49,116 --> 00:29:50,984
And make his wife
quite wealthy.

817
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:52,752
Yeah, that, too.

818
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:54,254
Have you done a scenario?

819
00:29:54,288 --> 00:29:56,222
Yeah.

820
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,857
Was the pipe a match?

821
00:29:57,892 --> 00:30:00,693
Uh, no. I ran a bunch of
different simulations,

822
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:03,463
and there were no scenarios
where the blows from the pipe

823
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:06,699
caused the damage
to the victim's skull.

824
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:08,968
So Lena Silver is
probably not the killer.

825
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:10,270
Yeah.

826
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:16,309
Hey, you said you wanted
to help me with my dress.

827
00:30:16,343 --> 00:30:18,811
Yeah.

828
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:21,848
I want you to look
at something.

829
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:28,488
Oh, my God.

830
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:30,223
Where did you get this?

831
00:30:30,257 --> 00:30:35,094
I've had it
since I was eight years old.

832
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:36,996
You've had this that whole time?

833
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:42,802
It's the dress I always imagined
I'd wear on my wedding day.

834
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:48,074
But then I grew up
and my life changed,

835
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:51,678
and I didn't think about it
until now.

836
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:58,051
Is it okay?

837
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:00,320
Yeah, it's perfect.

838
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:03,556
You might not admit it,

839
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:06,826
but you're a dreamer.

840
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:13,333
And this is...
this is your bucket list.

841
00:31:15,135 --> 00:31:17,470
I hope they can make it in time.

842
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,871
Well, they will,

843
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:21,908
or they'll have to answer to me.

844
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:25,545
No one messes
with the maid of honor.

845
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:28,081
I'm so happy for you.

846
00:31:32,753 --> 00:31:34,287
Oh, hey.

847
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:36,356
So, VAL still thinks
that there's a 96% probability

848
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,024
that Lena Silver
is the prime suspect.

849
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:39,826
What?!

850
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,829
No! The pipe isn't a match.
My profile completely dismisses

851
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:44,497
the possibility of her
as the murderer.

852
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:45,832
I know, I know,

853
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:47,967
but the department wants us
to factor in VAL

854
00:31:48,002 --> 00:31:50,203
every time we release a suspect.

855
00:31:50,237 --> 00:31:52,071
Seriously?
Yeah, seriously,

856
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:53,273
Sweets, seriously.

857
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:56,276
You know what I think
about that?

858
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,378
This is what I think about that.
Kicking it to the curb!

859
00:31:58,412 --> 00:32:00,113
Couldn't you get in trouble
for that?

860
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:01,614
Look, I don't mind trouble.

861
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:04,784
But if you're wrong about Lena,
I'm blaming you.

862
00:32:04,818 --> 00:32:06,953
Thank you, Booth. I-I really...

863
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:08,288
All right, enough.

864
00:32:08,322 --> 00:32:10,123
Don't get all mushy on me, okay?

865
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:11,924
We still have
a murder to solve.

866
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,259
I hate computers,
always have.

867
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:15,128
Let's look at some paper.

868
00:32:15,162 --> 00:32:17,864
Charlie McCord's will
was released today.

869
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:19,966
Look at that.

870
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,334
Oh, wow.

871
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:23,202
He was splitting
all future income

872
00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:25,338
from his speeches between Lena
and his wife.

873
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:26,806
And it explains

874
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,142
what his bucket list meant
by "making Lena whole."

875
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:30,943
Right.

876
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:33,780
Charlie's wife couldn't have
been too happy about that.

877
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:38,117
This little guy
is really sick.

878
00:32:38,152 --> 00:32:40,553
There's got to be some kind
of poison in his system.

879
00:32:40,587 --> 00:32:43,122
I'm running a blood culture
and tissue sample.

880
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:45,024
I studied veterinary science
for two years.

881
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,126
It doesn't appear
to be avian pox.

882
00:32:47,161 --> 00:32:48,328
Bird flu? You're going there?

883
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:49,595
That's a mutated strain.

884
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,930
I would've thought
you knew that.

885
00:32:50,964 --> 00:32:53,333
Don't start, Dr. Wells.
Sorry.

886
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,501
I just assume people usually
understand basic principles...

887
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:57,637
Dude, that is "starting."

888
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,272
Now, I found polyethylene,

889
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:01,074
styrene-butadiene, canvas,

890
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:04,210
cellulose and synthetic
rubbers inside the rangle,

891
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:06,124
but nothing in quantities
that would cause this.

892
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:09,682
Arsenic.

893
00:33:09,717 --> 00:33:11,617
Oh.

894
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:12,952
Arsenic in the wild?

895
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,887
No. There's no carbon.

896
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:16,889
It was poison, and
it was in the victim.

897
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:18,491
That's who the hawk
was feeding on.

898
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:20,226
The victim was poisoned.

899
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,829
We attributed the porous
bones to chemotherapy...

900
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:25,064
But Charlie stopped chemotherapy
almost a year ago.

901
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:26,366
So it was the arsenic

902
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,800
that prevented the bones
from remodeling.

903
00:33:27,835 --> 00:33:30,036
If it was the wife,
she's brilliant.

904
00:33:31,205 --> 00:33:33,239
In a murderous kind of way,
of course.

905
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:37,942
You must have been
pretty upset when you

906
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,944
found out that Charlie
changed his will.

907
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,379
Why would I be upset?

908
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:43,511
Because Charlie planned
on leaving Lena Silver

909
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:45,913
30% of the income generated
from his speeches.

910
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:47,227
That's, like, a million dollars.

911
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:49,750
Charlie felt terrible
for the woman.

912
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:51,385
He said he ruined her life.

913
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,620
She lost her kids.

914
00:33:52,654 --> 00:33:54,622
It's reasonable
for you to think

915
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:56,524
that money was
yours and not hers.

916
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:00,494
Have you even watched
any of Charlie's videos?

917
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:01,629
Yes.

918
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:03,197
I ordered
the whole series.

919
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:05,799
Then you know
what kind of man my husband was.

920
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:08,102
Kind, compassionate, generous.

921
00:34:08,136 --> 00:34:09,670
You ordered the whole series?

922
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:11,105
I found them
very inspiring, okay?

923
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,174
Look, just because
your husband was a good man

924
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,643
doesn't mean that
you're a good woman.

925
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:18,179
I wouldn't have taken a second
from Charlie's life.

926
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:20,381
This world is poorer
for him being gone.

927
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:23,384
I am amazed that everyone
doesn't feel it, but I do.

928
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:25,352
And yet, you fed him arsenic.

929
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:27,188
What?

930
00:34:27,222 --> 00:34:28,656
I did not.

931
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,024
The homeopathic remedies
you gave him.

932
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:31,492
They were just herbs

933
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:33,093
and other Ayurvedic remedies.

934
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:34,728
They contained arsenic.

935
00:34:34,763 --> 00:34:38,799
We found it in his system
when we examined his remains.

936
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,801
But you said that Charlie was
hit on the head.

937
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:42,236
Well, we're
gonna have to consider

938
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,638
the possibility
that you became impatient.

939
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:48,375
Oh, my God.

940
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,311
I was just trying
to help him.

941
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:53,380
I swear, that's all.

942
00:34:53,415 --> 00:34:56,116
I gave him that medicine
to help him.

943
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:06,894
If you look closely, the
depression fracture to the skull

944
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:10,464
has a slightly smaller hinge
on the bottom than the top.

945
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:12,099
That means it came from a blow

946
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:13,901
that was delivered
with an upward motion.

947
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:18,339
97% of strikes are by
an overhand motion.

948
00:35:18,373 --> 00:35:20,007
Yeah.

949
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:23,510
Dr. Brennan, would you like to
grab a coffee with me sometime?

950
00:35:23,545 --> 00:35:26,413
Maybe lunch
or perhaps dinner?

951
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:29,383
I'd pay.
What you're proposing,

952
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:30,884
Dr. Wells, is completely
inappropriate.

953
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:32,319
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

954
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:34,021
Not like a-a date.

955
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:36,590
I mean, it's a date,
but not a sexual date.

956
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:39,760
I-I don't have any friends.

957
00:35:39,794 --> 00:35:41,629
That's because
you're objectionable.

958
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:43,597
What I'm looking for is
someone that I can have

959
00:35:43,632 --> 00:35:45,299
a conversation with
without shutting down

960
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,700
three quarters of my brain.

961
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:48,202
I'm tired of being lonely,

962
00:35:48,236 --> 00:35:50,437
and I'm hoping
that you will be that person.

963
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:51,672
I decline, Dr. Wells.

964
00:35:51,706 --> 00:35:52,773
I don't like you.

965
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:54,375
So what?
I don't like you either.

966
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:55,676
What does that
have to do with anything?

967
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,244
The subject is closed.

968
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:59,780
The victim was struck
by a side-arm motion.

969
00:35:59,814 --> 00:36:01,515
Probably because
the killer

970
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:03,617
couldn't rotate
his arm from above.

971
00:36:03,652 --> 00:36:05,486
Yes, Dr. Hodgins?

972
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,454
Yes. Yes.

973
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:09,290
I, uh, I found traces of

974
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:10,991
cupronickel, uh,
on canvas threads

975
00:36:11,026 --> 00:36:12,593
in the last bit of rangle.

976
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:14,795
Quarters are made
from cupronickel.

977
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,997
I know what happened.

978
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:19,667
Oh, my God, I don't.

979
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:22,002
The canvas was a bank
bag for deposits.

980
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:23,671
Yeah, for the quarters
they raised for charity.

981
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:28,208
Martin Proctor struck him with
a bank bag full of quarters.

982
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:30,544
But what about his alibi?

983
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:33,614
Martin Proctor's alibi

984
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:36,750
is this movie ticket
that he just gave to Booth.

985
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:38,319
Can you prove that he bought it?

986
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:40,654
Well, there's a confirmation
code on the stub,

987
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:43,190
and usually the code will link
to a credit card purchase.

988
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:45,693
But he said he bought
the ticket in cash.

989
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:47,995
Yeah, and murderers never lie.

990
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:50,531
We think that Martin Proctor
killed Charlie McCord,

991
00:36:50,565 --> 00:36:52,966
which means he did not
purchase this movie ticket.

992
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:54,435
Okay.

993
00:36:57,572 --> 00:36:59,106
And you're right.

994
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,942
This was bought by credit
card by someone named

995
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:03,811
Loraine Nemitz.

996
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:05,746
He must have fished the ticket
out of the trash.

997
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,015
Martin Proctor
was never at the movies.

998
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:10,184
He has no alibi.

999
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:13,253
We know that this is
the deposit bag

1000
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:14,722
you ruckharles McCord with.

1001
00:37:14,756 --> 00:37:16,790
I was at a movie.
No, you weren't, okay?

1002
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:19,460
This is not your ticket.

1003
00:37:19,494 --> 00:37:23,030
All right? You have no alibi.

1004
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:24,798
Why? Why, Martin?

1005
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:26,400
Charlie was a good guy.

1006
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:28,235
Why'd you kill him?
